# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation Guide

This rule provides guidance for implementing and discussing MCP features in the presentation.

## Protocol Structure
- MCP follows a client-server architecture as shown in [index.html](mdc:index.html)
- Key components include MCP Hosts, Clients, Servers, and Data Sources
- Configuration is stored in `.cursor/mcp.json` files (project or global level)

## Code Examples
- When showing MCP configuration examples, use proper JSON syntax
- Include all required fields: `command`, `args`, and `env` where applicable
- Provide realistic but non-sensitive values for environment variables

## Terminology
- Refer to MCP as "Model Context Protocol" on first usage in a section
- Use consistent terminology as defined in the presentation
- Describe MCP as "a standardized way to connect AI models to data sources and tools"

When explaining MCP concepts, reference the diagrams and code examples from the existing presentation to maintain consistency.
