# Slide Transitions Guide

This rule defines the standard transition effects to use between slides for a cohesive presentation flow.

## Main Section Transitions
- Use the "zoom" transition effect for main section breaks
- Example: `<section data-transition="zoom">`
- This visually signals to the audience a major topic change

## Standard Slide Transitions
- Use "slide" transition by default for sequential content
- Example: `<section data-transition="slide">`
- Maintain left-to-right flow for logical progression of ideas

## Special Effect Transitions
- Use "fade" for revealing supporting details or examples
- Example: `<section data-transition="fade">`
- Use "convex" for introducing demo sections
- Example: `<section data-transition="convex">`

## Nested Slides
- For nested/vertical slides, use consistent "fade" transitions
- Example: 
```html
<section>
  <section data-transition="fade">First vertical slide</section>
  <section data-transition="fade">Second vertical slide</section>
</section>
```

## Code Demo Transitions
- When transitioning to live code demonstrations, use "concave" transition
- Example: `<section data-transition="concave">`
- This visually prepares the audience for interactive content

When adding new slides, select the appropriate transition based on the content's relationship to previous slides to create a natural, flowing presentation experience.
